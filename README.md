# Boilerplate Project

A boilerplate project created in flutter using MobX and Provider. Boilerplate supports both web and mobile, clone the appropriate branches mentioned below:

* For Mobile: https://github.com/zubairehman/flutter-boilerplate-project/tree/master (stable channel)
* For Web: https://github.com/zubairehman/flutter-boilerplate-project/tree/feature/web-support (beta channel)

# The difference with the original boilerplate

1. Enhance navigation using the package `page_transition` for more customizable transitions.
2. Integrate Sentry for error reporting.
3. Add utils class to show common messages and dialogs.
4. Add Lint to the project and fix all the linting issues.
5. Enhance localization using the package `intl`. This will allow you to easily localize your app with more customization.
6. Simple folder structure when using firebase (Firestore).

**Firebase:**

Checkout branch `feature/firebase` for firebase support.

## Getting Started

The Boilerplate contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using boiler plate code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.

## How to Use 

**Step 1:**

Download or clone this repo by using the link below:

```
https://github.com/kitemetric/flutter-boilerplate-project.git
```

**Step 2:**

Go to project root and execute the following command in console to get the required dependencies: 

```
flutter pub get 
```

**Step 3:**

This project uses `inject` library that works with code generation, execute the following command to generate files:

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

or watch command in order to keep the source code synced automatically:

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
```

**Step 4: intl (l10n)**

This project uses `l10n` library that works with code generation, execute the following command to generate files:

```
flutter gen-l10n
```

**Step 5: Setup Sentry**

This project uses `Sentry` so you have to add Sentry DNS to be able to use Sentry in the project. Change the ```option.dns``` in `main.dart` or disable all Sentry related code in `main.dart` to disable Sentry.

## Hide Generated Files

In-order to hide generated files, navigate to `Android Studio` -> `Preferences` -> `Editor` -> `File Types` and paste the below lines under `ignore files and folders` section:

```
*.inject.summary;*.inject.dart;*.g.dart;
```

In Visual Studio Code, navigate to `Preferences` -> `Settings` and search for `Files:Exclude`. Add the following patterns:
```
**/*.inject.summary
**/*.inject.dart
**/*.g.dart
```

### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- constants/
|- data/
|- stores/
|- ui/
|- utils/
|- widgets/
|- main.dart
|- routes.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- constants - All the application level constants are defined in this directory with-in their respective files. This directory contains the constants for `theme`, `dimentions`, `api endpoints`, `preferences` and `strings`.
2- data - Contains the data layer of your project, includes directories for local, network and shared pref/cache.
3- stores - Contains store(s) for state-management of your application, to connect the reactive data of your application with the UI. 
4- ui‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains all the ui of your project, contains sub directory for each screen.
5- util‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains the utilities/common functions of your application.
6- widgets‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains the common widgets for your applications. For example, Button, TextField etc.
7- routes.dart‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThis file contains all the routes for your application.
8- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.
```

### Constants

This directory contains all the application level constants. A separate file is created for each type as shown in example below:

```
constants/
|- app_theme.dart
|- dimens.dart
|- endpoints.dart
|- preferences.dart
|- strings.dart
```

### Data

All the business logic of your application will go into this directory, it represents the data layer of your application. It is sub-divided into three directories `local`, `network` and `sharedperf`, each containing the domain specific logic. Since each layer exists independently, that makes it easier to unit test. The communication between UI and data layer is handled by using central repository.

```
data/
|- local/
    |- constants/
    |- datasources/
    |- app_database.dart
   
|- network/
    |- constants/
    |- exceptions/
    |- rest_client.dart
    
|- sharedpref
    |- constants/
    |- shared_preference_helper.dart
    
|- repository.dart

```

### Stores

The store is where all your application state lives in flutter. The Store is basically a widget that stands at the top of the widget tree and passes it's data down using special methods. In-case of multiple stores, a separate folder for each store is created as shown in the example below:

```
stores/
|- login/
    |- login_store.dart
    |- form_validator.dart
```

### UI

This directory contains all the ui of your application. Each screen is located in a separate folder making it easy to combine group of files related to that particular screen. All the screen specific widgets will be placed in `widgets` directory as shown in the example below:

```
ui/
|- login
   |- login_screen.dart
   |- widgets
      |- login_form.dart
      |- login_button.dart
```

### Utils

Contains the common file(s) and utilities used in a project. The folder structure is as follows: 

```
utils/
|- encryption
   |- xxtea.dart
|- date
  |- date_time.dart
```

### Widgets

Contains the common widgets that are shared across multiple screens. For example, Button, TextField etc.

```
widgets/
|- app_icon_widget.dart
|- empty_app_bar.dart
|- progress_indicator.dart
```

### Routes

This file contains all the routes for your application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'ui/home/home.dart';
import 'ui/login/login.dart';
import 'ui/splash/splash.dart';

class Routes {
  Routes._();

  //static variables
  static const String splash = '/splash';
  static const String login = '/login';
  static const String home = '/home';

  static final routes = <String, WidgetBuilder>{
    splash: (BuildContext context) => SplashScreen(),
    login: (BuildContext context) => LoginScreen(),
    home: (BuildContext context) => HomeScreen(),
  };
}
```

### Main

This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.

```dart
import 'package:boilerplate/routes.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

import 'constants/app_theme.dart';
import 'constants/strings.dart';
import 'ui/splash/splash.dart';

void main() {
  SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations([
    DeviceOrientation.portraitUp,
    DeviceOrientation.portraitDown,
    DeviceOrientation.landscapeRight,
    DeviceOrientation.landscapeLeft,
  ]).then((_) {
    runApp(MyApp());
  });
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: Strings.appName,
      theme: themeData,
      routes: Routes.routes,
      home: SplashScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have on this approach, and if you want to lend a hand with the boilerplate then please feel free to submit an issue and/or pull request üôÇ

Again to note, this is example can appear as over-architectured for what it is - but it is an example only. If you liked my work, don‚Äôt forget to ‚≠ê star the repo to show your support.


## Setting CI-CD
Web-Android using github actions, iOS using Codemagic

**Web and Android auto build and deploy/public to Firebase hosting/Internal Testing CH Play when trigger occurred, the only thing have to do is config env (only git repo owner can do that)**

### Web
**Config env**

You have to set the values below to GitHub secrets. [How to set the value to GitHub secrets.](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/blob/master/assets/create-secrets-for-GitHub-workflows.md)

`FIREBASE_TOKEN`

How to get FIREBASE_TOKEN: run cmd `firebase login:ci`

### Android
You have to set the value to GitHub secrets. [How to set the value to GitHub secrets.](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/blob/master/assets/create-secrets-for-GitHub-workflows.md)

`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`

`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`

`ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`

`ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`

`GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`

`ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME`

[How to get the above values.](https://viblo.asia/p/cai-dat-don-gian-automating-publishing-flutter-app-len-google-play-bang-github-actions-63vKjg1dZ2R)

### iOS
To automatic build and deploy new version to TestFlight, we using **CodeMagic** 

**Step 1: Register**

Register your app on Codemagic, fetch your codemagic.yaml to Codemagic

**Step 2: Setup**

*Environment*:  need to provide the following values:
```yaml
    PROVISIONING_PROFILE: # A file prefixed with .mobileprovision
    CERTIFICATE: #A file prefixed with .p12 
    CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD: #When you create a certificate, it will include a password for this certificate, remember it
    flutter: #Target flutter version
    xcode: #Target xcode version
    cocoapods: #Target cocoapods version
```
[What's Provision Profile and How to get?](https://viblo.asia/p/phan-3-provisioning-profiles-gAm5yjqLKdb)

[What's Certificate and How to get?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9418661/how-to-create-p12-certificate-for-ios-distribution)

*Trigger*:  When the trigger occurs, the application will automatically build
```yaml
triggering:     
      events:
        - tag
      branch_patterns:
        - pattern: '*'
          include: true
          source: true
      tag_patterns:
        - pattern: release-production*
          include: true
```
Current trigger: push tag with tag's name: `release-production*` or `release-staging*`, `*` can be version name like `-v2.1.0`

*Publishing*:  need to provide some information to be able to automatically publish the app to testflight
```yaml
    publishing:
      # have to config
      app_store_connect: 
        api_key:
        key_id:
        issuer_id:
        submit_to_testflight: false
        submit_to_app_store: false
```
Only role `ADMIN` in `User and Access` can create new api key and get them [Setup App Store Connect API key](https://support.appmachine.com/support/solutions/articles/80001023345-v2-how-to-setup-app-store-connect-api-key)

However, you still have to manual the last step at testflight to roll out for testers.


CodeMagic provides 2 ways for setup the workflow, above I mentioned how to use .yaml file to write workflow.
In addition, you can refer to how to use Workflow Editor to create your workflow at [Easy to setup CodeMagic!](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-quick-start/building-a-flutter-app/)
